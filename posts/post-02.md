Let's Get Started:

**Step 1: Foundation Chain**
Start by making a foundation chain of 160 stitches. Adjust the length if you want a larger or smaller blanket.

**Step 2: Row 1 - Half Double Crochet**
In the third chain from the hook, work a hdc. *Skip 2 chains, then work 3 hdc in the next chain.* Repeat this pattern across the row, ending with a hdc in the last chain. Turn your work.

**Step 3: Row 2 - Single Crochet Mesh**
Chain 1 (does not count as a stitch). *Work 1 sc in the first hdc from the previous row. Ch 2, skip the next 2 hdc, and work 1 sc in the next hdc.* Repeat this pattern across the row, ending with a sc in the last hdc. Turn your work.

**Step 4: Row 3 - Treble Crochet Fans**
Chain 4 (counts as the first tr). *Skip the next ch-2 space, work 1 tr in the next sc, ch 2, work 1 tr in the same sc.* Repeat this pattern across the row, ending with a tr in the last sc. Turn your work.

**Step 5: Repeat Rows 2 and 3**
Continue alternating between Row 2 and Row 3 until your blanket reaches the desired length. Feel free to experiment with color changes to create a mesmerizing pattern.

**Step 6: Final Row - Double Crochet Border**
Work a final row of dc around the entire blanket to create a neat border. In each corner, work 3 dc to maintain a smooth edge.

**Step 7: Finish**
After completing the final row, fasten off and weave in any loose ends with a yarn needle.
